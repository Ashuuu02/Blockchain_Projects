THEORETICAL PARTS OF BLOCKCHAIN
 
1. Blockchain Definition  
A blockchain is a decentralized, immutable digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each "block" contains:  
- Transaction data  
- A cryptographic hash of the previous block  
- A timestamp  
- A unique nonce (number used once)

Blocks are linked by cryptographic hashes, forming a tamper-proof chain. If a block is tampered with, its hash is disrupted, destroying the chain and notifying the network. This distributed architecture avoids single points of failure and allows trustless authentication through consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. Blockchains form the basis for cryptocurrencies and use cases involving secure, transparent record-keeping.

**Real-Life Use Cases:**
1. **Supply Chain Tracking**: Walmart utilizes blockchain to track food items from farm to store, minimizing risks of contamination and verification time from days to seconds.  
2. **Digital Identity**: Estonia's e-Residency program keeps citizen IDs in blockchain, allowing secure digital signatures and access to government services without identity theft.

Merkle Root Explained:
The Merkle root is one hash that encapsulates all transactions in a block. For 4 transactions (TX1-TX4):
1. Hash each transaction: `H1 = SHA256(TX1)`, `H2 = SHA256(TX2)`, etc.
2. Hash pairs of combined hashes: `H12 = SHA256(H1 + H2)`, `H34 = SHA256(H3 + H4)`
3. Final hash: `Merkle Root = SHA256(H12 + H34)`

**Verification Example**:
If TX3 is changed:
- `H3` changes → `H34` changes → Merkle root changes
- The block's hash is invalid
- Tampering is detected without looking at all transactions

3. Consensus Mechanisms

**Proof of Work (PoW)**
Miners engage in a competition to solve cryptographic puzzles by discovering a nonce which results in a hash satisfying difficulty requirements (e.g., beginning with "0000"). It requires enormous computational power because:
1. Brute-force trial-and-error is the only solution
2. Difficulty adapts to keep ~10 min/block (Bitcoin)
3. Energy use holds the network together by making attacks too costly

**Proof of Stake (PoS)**
Validators are selected according to how much cryptocurrency they "stake" (lock) as collateral. Most notable differences from PoW:
- No energy-hungry mining: validators are selected at random
- Safety derived from economic interest (cut for malicious behavior)
- Much more energy-conservative (e.g., Ethereum's migration)
 
**Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**
Holders of tokens vote on delegates (e.g., 21 "witnesses" in EOS). Characteristics:
1. Delegates alternate in building blocks
2. Choice of validator based on number of votes, not processing capability
3. Highest-voted delegates alternate validating transactions
4. Voters can replace underperforming delegates instantly
